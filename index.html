          <h2>Who was Stan Lee?</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Stan Lee </b> (born <b>Stanley Martin Lieber</b>  /ˈliːbər/; December 28, 1922
            – November 12, 2018) was an American comic book writer, editor,
            publisher, and producer. He rose through the ranks of a family-run
            business called Timely Publications which would later become Marvel
            Comics. He was the primary creative leader for two decades, leading
            its expansion from a small division of a publishing house to a
            multimedia corporation that dominated the comics and film
            industries.
          </p>
          <p>
            In collaboration with others at Marvel—particularly
            co-writers/artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko—he co-created iconic
            characters, including superheroes Spider-Man, the X-Men, Iron Man,
            Thor, the Hulk, Ant-Man, the Wasp, the Fantastic Four, Black
            Panther, Daredevil, Doctor Strange, Scarlet Witch, and Black Widow.
            These and other characters' introductions in the 1960s pioneered a
            more naturalistic approach in superhero comics, and in the 1970s Lee
            challenged the restrictions of the Comics Code Authority, indirectly
            leading to changes in its policies. In the 1980s he pursued the
            development of Marvel properties in other media, with mixed results.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following his retirement from Marvel in the 1990s, Lee remained a
            public figurehead for the company, and frequently made cameo
            appearances in films and television shows based on Marvel
            characters, on which he received an executive producer credit. He
            continued independent creative ventures into his 90s until his death
            in 2018. Lee was inducted into the comic book industry's Will Eisner
            Award Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1995.
            He received the NEA's National Medal of Arts in 2008.
